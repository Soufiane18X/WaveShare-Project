# 🌊 WaveShare – Volunteer & Surf in Morocco

## 1. Project Overview

### a. Context  
In Morocco, surf houses often look for help with daily tasks in exchange for accommodation. At the same time, young people (Moroccan and international) seek unique, affordable experiences. Local associations also need volunteers. This platform will connect volunteers with hosts (surf houses, NGOs, youth centers), focusing on areas like Taghazout and Tamraght.

### b. Main Goal  
Develop a full-stack MERN application that:
- Connects hosts (surf houses, NGOs) and volunteers.
- Provides local and international opportunities.
- Supports commission-based monetization.
- Uses AI to help users (ex: match volunteers to tasks, auto-generate messages).
- Works well on both desktop and mobile.
